    # This requires State to have a concept of initial/reset positions.
    # Assuming State resets to positions defined during its creation or defaults.
    # We need to know what the reset positions are. Let's assume they are the same as initial state creation defaults.
    # This requires the State class to store or recalculate initial positions for reset.
    # Let's assume State resets to the positions it had upon initial creation (or a specific reset state).
    # This means the ball should be at the center (or initial ball pos) and players at their initial spots.

    # Check ball position reset (assuming it goes back to the initial ball position)
    # This implies State needs to remember or calculate the initial ball position.
    # Let's assume State has a `reset_positions` method or that `handle_goal` calls it.
    # And let's assume the reset position is the initial one used when creating the State object.
    # If State has a default initial ball position (like 0,0), we test against that.
    # If State was initialized with specific initial positions, it should reset to those.
    # Let's assume State resets to its default initial positions (like 0,0 for ball).
    # This requires State to have default initial positions or store the ones it was initialized with.
    # Let's assume State resets the ball to its default initial position (e.g., 0,0).
    # And players to their default initial positions.

    # To make this test robust, we need State to either:
    # 1. Be initialized with specific reset positions and reset to those.
    # 2. Have well-defined default reset positions.
    # Let's assume State has a method `get_initial_positions()` or similar, or that
    # the reset positions are the same as the state right after `State()` is called.

    # Re-initialize a reference state to compare against the reset state

    assert state.score['teamA'] == initial_score['teamA'] + 1 # Score for A remains
    assert state.score['teamB'] == initial_score['teamB'] + 1 # Score for B increases
